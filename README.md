This repo contains my finished code of Prof. Mirza's cs16-sp17 projects. Back in the days when I took Prof. Costanzo's CS16 at Winter 2018, I didn't do great on his projects and exams for several reasons:

1.I has never been exposed to formal programming, and I was extremely ignorant and naively telling myself that i didn't have to pay that musch attention to programming becasue I am an EE major. I didn't finish much of the assigned reading, which turned out to be the main source of the exam questions. 
    
2.I was taking five courses--21 units--at that quarter. And it proved that the best work load for me is between 16~18 units. 

However, I soon learned about the importance of all these fundamental concepts of data structure, as I gradually developed an understanding of the general structure of computer from the bottom to top level. The concepts about tree, linked list, stack and queue, are one of many crucial parts of EECS. So, after introspeting over my ill-posed mindsets, I decided to review and enhance the knowledge convered in CS16 using Prof. Mirza's archive online. 

The code of finished labs and parts of the homeworks are all contained in this repo.
